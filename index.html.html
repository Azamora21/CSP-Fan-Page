			<li>First Planet from the sun
			<li>The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from 100 to 700 K (−173 to 427 °C; −280 to 800 °F)
			<li>During a flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, MESSENGER discovered that Mercury's magnetic field can be extremely "leaky"

	        <li>Venus may have had a shallow liquid-water ocean and habitable surface temperatures for up to 2 billion years
	        <li>Venus became extremely hot due to a runaway greenhouse affect
	        <li>Venus' solid surface is a volcanic landscape covered with extensive plains featuring high volcanic mountains and vast ridged plateaus.

	     <h1>Earth</h1>

	        <li>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.</li>
	        <li>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface</li>
	        <li>Earth is the only planet, that we know of, that is able to harbor life.</li>

	    <h1>Mars</h1>
	    <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/"> <img src="https://img.purch.com/w/640/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA3OC8xMzYvaTAyL2h1YmJsZW1hcnMuanBnPzE1MzMwNDE3MjU=" height=500 width=500 title="Mars" alt="Mars"> </a>
	        <li>The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
	        <li>It is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.
	        <li>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids.

	        <li>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is the largest planet in the solar system with twice the mass than all the other planets combined.
	        <li>Jupiter is surrounded by 79 known moons. Scientists are most interested in the Galilean satellites; Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
	        <li> The Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm in Jupiter, it is twice as wide as Earth.

	    <h1>Saturn</h1>
	    <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/in-depth/"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Saturn_eclipse.jpg" height=300 width=550 title="Saturn" alt="Saturn"> </a>
	        <li>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system.
	        <li>Adorned with a dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets.
	        <li>Saturns satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.

	        <li>The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy.</li>
	        <li>The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.</li>
	        <li>Uranus likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago.</li>

        <h1>Neptune</h1>
        <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/neptune/in-depth/"> <img src="https://img.purch.com/w/640/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzAwNS80OTYvaTAyL25lcHR1bmUtcG9zc2libGUtY29tZXQtaW1wYWN0LTEwMDcyMi0wMi5qcGc/MTI5MjI3MDk1Mg==" height=400 width=600 title="Neptune" alt="Neptune"> </a>
            <li>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.</li>
            <li>In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.</li>
            <li>Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us.</li>

            <li>Pluto is a complex and mysterious world of mountains, valleys, plains and craters.</li>
            <li>Pluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system.</li>
